If you've lost your radio remote or want a different one, you can pair the Flipper Zero with your receiver as a remote. The **Add Manually** feature lets you create a virtual radio remote of the same type as your receiver. You can then pair your Flipper Zero with your receiver as a remote by emulating the virtual remote you created.

On this page, you will learn how to add a new remote control and link it to your receiver.

Before using Flipper Zero as a radio remote control, you must manually create a virtual remote control by following these steps:

1. Go to **Main Menu -> Sub-GHz -> Add manually**
2. Select a protocol from the list and then press **OK**
3. Give the remote control a name and then press **Save.**

### Pairing procedure <a href="#hmfpr" id="hmfpr"></a>

Once the remote control has been added to the list and saved, you can pair Flipper Zero with your receiver as a radio remote control. To pair it, you must activate pairing mode on your receiver and send a signal from Flipper Zero according to your receiver's instructions.

Read the receiver instructions before pairing. Receivers have different pairing procedures, so read the instructions before pairing Flipper Zero with your receiver.﻿
