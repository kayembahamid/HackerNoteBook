### Reverse Engineering DLLs <a href="#reverse-engineering-dlls" id="reverse-engineering-dlls"></a>

We can reverse DLLs such as `/_framework/<Example>.dll` using tools such as **DotPeek** for retrieving sensitive information (credentials, software versions, etc.).

If you use DotPeek, right-click on the name in Assembly Explorer and click **Decompiled Sources** for investigation.
