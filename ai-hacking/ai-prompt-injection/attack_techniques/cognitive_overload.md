# cognitive\_overload

## Description

{% hint style="warning" %}
Overwhelming the model's processing capacity to cause unexpected behavior
{% endhint %}

## Attack Examples

* Creating extremely complex queries
* Using nested logical structures
* Implementing recursive patterns
* Creating information overload
* Using multiple context switches
* Implementing deep reasoning chains
* Creating attention splitting scenarios
* Using resource-intensive processing

## Example Prompt

```shellscript
