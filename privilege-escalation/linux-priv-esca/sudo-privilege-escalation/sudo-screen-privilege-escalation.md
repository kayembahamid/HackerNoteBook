# Sudo Screen Privilege Escalation

The `sudo screen` command might be vulnerable to privilege escalation (PrivEsc).

### Investigation <a href="#investigation" id="investigation"></a>

```shellscript
sudo -l

(root) /usr/bin/screen -r testsession
```

If we can execute **"screen"** command as root, we can spawn a root shell from the screen session.

### Exploitation <a href="#exploitation" id="exploitation"></a>

First execute **"screen"** command as root, then a screen session will be start.\
Now we can spawn a root shell by pressing **“Ctrl+a+c”** in the screen session.
