Password Save is a password database utility. We may retrieve passwords for users.

Go to the [release page](https://github.com/pwsafe/pwsafe/releases) and download it.

For example, if you use Debian, download `.deb` package and run the following command:

### Crack `.pwsafe` Password <a href="#crack-pwsafe-password" id="crack-pwsafe-password"></a>

If the password is required to open `.pwsafe` file in the PasswordSafe manger, we might be able to crack the password of the `.pwsafe` file as below:

john --wordlist=wordlist.txt hash.txt
```
