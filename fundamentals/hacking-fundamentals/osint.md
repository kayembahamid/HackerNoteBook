When starting an OSINT investigation, your first step is typically to gather as much initial information as possible about your target. This helps you establish a foundation for further research. Here are some key steps to take:

* Define your research objective: Determine the specific goal of your investigation. Are you trying to gather information about a person, a company, an event, or a specific topic? Clarify what you want to achieve with your OSINT research.
* Collect basic information: Start by gathering any basic information you may already have about your target. This could include their name, email address, social media handles, phone number, location, or any other relevant details. This initial information will help you kick-start your investigation.
* Conduct a preliminary search: Begin with a basic search using search engines like Google, Bing, or DuckDuckGo. Enter the target's name, username, or any other identifying information to see what publicly available information is already out there. Take note of any relevant search results, social media profiles, news articles, or public records that you come across.
* Explore social media platforms: Check if your target has accounts on popular social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, or others. Look for their profiles, posts, connections, and any publicly available information that could provide insights into their activities, interests, or affiliations.
* Review online presence: Investigate the target's online presence beyond social media. This may include personal websites, blogs, forums, or online communities where they might be active. Look for any content they have created, comments they have made, or interactions they have had with others.
* Search public records: Depending on your target and the available resources, search public records such as business registries, property records, court documents, or government databases. These sources can provide valuable information about professional affiliations, legal history, financial records, or other relevant details.
* Utilize specialized OSINT tools: Consider using specialized OSINT tools and platforms that can help automate and streamline your research process. These tools may offer advanced search capabilities, data aggregation, or specific features tailored for OSINT investigations.
