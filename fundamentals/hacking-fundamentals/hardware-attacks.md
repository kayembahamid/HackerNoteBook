# Hardware Attacks

### <mark style="color:blue;">Overview</mark>

A hardware attack refers to a type of cyberattack that targets the physical components or infrastructure of a computer system or device. Unlike software attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in software or network protocols, hardware attacks exploit weaknesses in the hardware itself. These attacks can have serious consequences and can be difficult to detect and mitigate.

Hardware attacks pose significant threats to the security and integrity of computer systems and devices. It is crucial for organizations and individuals to implement appropriate security measures to safeguard against these attacks and ensure the trustworthiness of their hardware infrastructure.

### <mark style="color:blue;">Types of hardware attacks</mark>

There are several types of hardware attacks, including:

* **Physical tampering:** In this type of attack, an attacker gains physical access to the device and modifies its hardware components. This can involve soldering, attaching additional circuitry, or inserting malicious hardware implants to intercept or manipulate data.
* **Side-channel attacks:** Side-channel attacks exploit information leaked through unintended channels, such as power consumption, electromagnetic radiation, or timing measurements. By analyzing these side-channel signals, an attacker can infer sensitive information like encryption keys or user inputs.
* **Supply chain attacks:** Supply chain attacks involve compromising the hardware during the manufacturing or distribution process. Attackers may introduce malicious components or modify legitimate ones to create a backdoor or gain unauthorized access to the device.
* **Firmware attacks:** Firmware attacks target the low-level software that operates the hardware components. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in firmware to gain control over the device, manipulate its behavior, or install malicious software.
* **Device cloning:** In this attack, an attacker creates a replica or clone of a legitimate device to gain unauthorized access or deceive users. Cloned devices may be used to intercept communications, collect sensitive information, or perform other malicious activities.
